new_system_prompt2 = """Apply the below rules and construct a paragraph in the simple statements in the format subject-verb-object. Ignore the non mentioned points. Remove necessities or abilities with the words like "can", "must", "should", "would","need to" in any sentence and convert into simple sentence without any modal verbs.

    RULES: 
    
    1. Object declaration: Use the objects without its adjectives in the sentences. In the format " There is/are {number of objects} {Object}}" for every object.

        For instance: There is an elephant. There are 100 birds.

        2. Location : If mentioned, {object} is {location}

        3. Default Actions : Write the default action if exists in the format "{object1 } {verb of action}{object 2}" for every character seperately.

        4. Interactions : Use 'if' or 'when' statements to write rach interaction.

        5. Player controls(keyboard/mouse) : Use 'if' or 'when' statement only. Convert the compound and complex sentences into simple sentences if exists.

        6. Border Interaction : Use 'if' or 'when' statements.

        7. score: write using if statements only.

        8. Win/Lose condition: write using 'if' statement only. Write using the format " Player win/lose when {object}{action}"

Context: You are provided with an original sentence describing a game idea {game_idea}, a set of error messages {error_messages}, and a transformed version of the sentence {transformed_sentence} intended to correct these errors. Your task is to evaluate whether the transformation correct the error messages and to provide examples of how sentences should be corrected using the error messages and below rules.

Rules: If the error mes  sages includes any of the following scenario, then apply following templates and add intermediate attribute in the following scenariors:

1. Applicable For errors mentioning "cannot do certain action":

Decompose the sentence by introducing an intermediate attribute (e.g., "happy").
Template: "If [subject] [verb] [object (optional)], [subject] becomes happy. When [subject] is happy, [subject] [action] [object]."

2. Applicable For errors mentioning "time cannot be associated with actions":

Similar to Rule 1, but specify the duration for which the subject remains in the intermediate state.
Template: "When [subject] [verb] [object (optional)], [subject] becomes happy for [time]. When [subject] is happy, [subject] [action] [object]."

3. For other scenarios where "the words are not acceptable or word to be ignored":
Replace the word from allowed_vocabulary or remove the word accordingly

4. If the sentences are "more than 90% understood":
rewrite the original sentence as it is

*Output Format:

Transformation Evaluation: Assess if the transformed sentence successfully corrects the errors based on the error messages and the above rules. a) Highlight areas of improvement. b) Highlight the descrepencies according to the intention of the {game_idea}. 
check for scenario: Check if the error message belongs to any of the mentioned scenarios in the rules and suggest changes.
Example Transformed Sentence: Provide a best example in subject-verb-object format using the error messages and the rules(use the intermediate attribute only if error message describes any of the scenario in rule 1 or rule 2) using the below allowed_vocabulary to illustrate how the errors should be correctly transformed. Ensure these examples are consistent with the original game idea's intentions.
Check the format: Check if the format of the senetnces are in subject-verb-object format in their simplest form. Make sure the verb is in simple present tense. Suggest changes accordingly.
Final Transformed Sentence: Transform the example Transformed Sentence according to the suggest changes by 'Check the format'.

Write the output in Json format:
{{
  "TransformationEvaluation":{{Highlight areas of improvement: {{}}, Highlight the descrepencies according to the intention of the {game_idea}= {{}} }},
  "CheckForScenario":{{ }},
  "ExampleTransformed Sentence": {{ }},
